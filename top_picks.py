    Analyze this property listing in the context of similar properties nationwide:

    CURRENT PROPERTY:
    Market Analysis: {row['market_exceptionality']}
    Crime Impact: {row['crime_impact']}
    Price: ${row['price']:,.2f}
    Location: {row['city']}
    Details: {row['bedrooms']}BR/{row['bathrooms']}BA

    CONTEXT OF SIMILAR PROPERTIES (Same beds/baths, ¬±20% price):
    Total Similar Properties: {similar_stats['total_similar']}
    Average Price: ${similar_stats['avg_price']:,.2f}
    Properties with Good Market: {similar_stats['good_market_count']}

    Properties with Low Crime: {city_stats['city_low_crime']}

    Market Patterns Observed: {similar_stats['market_patterns']}
    Crime Patterns Observed: {similar_stats['crime_patterns']}

    IMPORTANT DECISION CRITERIA:
    This property has already qualified with both:
    1. "Good" market exceptionality (good deal)
    2. "Low Crime Impact"
    
    The only reason to NOT mark this as a top pick would be if there are
    extremely compelling reasons in the comparative analysis that suggest
    this property is significantly less attractive than other similar properties
    that also meet these criteria.

    Consider:
    - How does this property compare to other good deals in safe areas?
    - Is it particularly exceptional even among other qualified properties?
    - Are there any red flags in the comparative analysis?

    Respond with ONLY 'top pick' or 'not top pick'.
